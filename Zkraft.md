Project Name

Zkraft by Henry Okparanwankwo



Project Description

Zkraft is an on-chain smart contract platform that allows Cairo developers to post their code, describe bugs or improvement needs, and attach STRK bounties to attract solutions. Contributors submit fixes or enhancements, and once a solution is accepted by the project owner, the bounty is automatically released on-chain. This creates a trustless, transparent way to get help with real smart contract problems — from debugging to optimization — powered entirely by the StarkNet ecosystem.

🔧 App Features – What Zkraft Offers

📦 On-Chain Repositories Developers can create repositories as smart contracts directly on StarkNet, with immutable ownership and metadata stored via IPFS.

🎯 Bounty Creation Add bounties to any repo for fixing bugs, improving logic, or adding features — paid in STRK or any supported token.

📤 Code + Problem Submission Upload the current codebase and describe exactly what needs improvement (e.g. “optimize loop gas cost”, “fix function revert”).

👥 Contributor Interaction Contributors can browse open bounties, submit solutions, and get rewarded automatically when their work is accepted.

🔐 Trustless Payouts Once a solution is marked accepted by the repo owner, Zkraft automatically releases bounty tokens to the contributor — no manual transfers.
