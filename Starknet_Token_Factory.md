### **Starknet Token Factory**

**Submission by:** Joseph Aleonomoh


### **Project Description**

**Starknet Token Factory** is a decentralized application (dApp) for creating and managing tokens on Starknet. It offers a clean, user-friendly interface that empowers everyday users, especially non-developers or those unable to hire one to easily deploy their own personalized **ERC-20** or **ERC-721** tokens.

With this platform, users can:

* Launch their own tokens without writing a single line of Cairo code.
* Tokenize real-world assets into NFTs.
* Manage deployed tokens efficiently via an intuitive dashboard.

By lowering the technical barrier to token creation, the Starknet Token Factory helps drive broader adoption of decentralized technologies and asset tokenization.
